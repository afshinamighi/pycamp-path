# Introduction

The collection covers a learning path for Basics of Python Programming. This learning path covers questions and acitivities around topics that are essential to practice as a Python Programmer learner.

# Learning Objectives:

By the end of this course, the student should be able to (practically): 
- Analyse given basic programming problem statements and take an approach to tackle.  
- Develop programs in Python. The minimum is a console-based programs with ability to interact with data fles and a user. An acceptable complexity of the application can be a software program with 3 ~ 6 classes interacting with each other. 
- Have a level of understanding about best practices in coding. 
- Understand existing code and be able to modify and add some features to it. The student should also be able to find and fix syntactical and semantical errors. 
- Apply basic debugging and testing methods on programs so that that the program meets the specifications. 
- Employ basic development tools in his/her software development processes: At least one IDE, debugging features, version control (basics)..
